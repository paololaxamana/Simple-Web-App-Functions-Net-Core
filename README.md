This tutorial teaches the basics of building a web API with ASP.NET Core.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

Create a web API project.
Add a model class and a database context.
Scaffold a controller with CRUD methods.
Configure routing, URL paths, and return values.
Call the web API with Postman.
